                                            <li>The warranty on the product is 30 minutes from the date of its purchase, subject to compliance with all the rules and conditions of working with accounts. This means that if you have problems with your account within the first 30 minutes after purchase and you have followed all the instructions and rules, the store guarantees the replacement or return of the goods.</li>
                                            <li>The purchased valid item cannot be returned or replaced.

                                            <br><br>

                                            <h6>Follow the recommendations for working with accounts to ensure security and efficiency:</h6>
                                            <br><br>

                                            <h6>Use high-quality proxy servers.</h6>
                                            <li>Problem: If you log in to multiple accounts from the same IP address, all your accounts can be blocked</li>
                                            <li>Solution: Use quality proxy servers, such as individual IPv4 proxies or Resident proxies. Avoid using package proxies and browser extensions such as Hola, FreeVPN, etc. It is also not recommended to use an IPv6 proxy.</li>

                                            <br><br>

                                            <h6> Use different devices to log in to different accounts.</h6>
                                            <li> Problem: If you log in to multiple accounts from one device (computer, phone, tablet), all your accounts can be blocked.</li>
                                            <li> Solution: Use different devices or specialized programs and services to work with different accounts. A regular browser window, incognito mode or clearing cookies are not considered different devices.</li>

                                            <br><br>

                                            <h6> What are different devices: </h6>
                                            <li> computer, second computer</li>
                                            <li> phone, second phone</li>
                                            <li> profile program for logging in to accounts</li>
                                            <li> change of UserAgent in the browser and other actions with the browser</li>
                                            <li> the use of special browsers that change these devices themselves.</li>

                                            <br><br>

                                            <h6> Observe limits and conduct human-like activities. </h6>
                                            <li> Problem: If you immediately start actively working with accounts (mass likes, mass messaging, etc.), your accounts can be quickly blocked.</li>
                                            <li>Solution: For safe work with accounts, it is recommended to first perform some of the usual actions that a real user usually does when registering.</li>
                                            <li> Example: Fill out a profile, subscribe to several users, leave a few likes, add a few photos, make reposts, comments, etc.</li>
